FEWD assignment 1

## Introduction
 Hello my name is **Sergio Montero** and I am 30 years old. I was born and raised in San Diego California. Currently I have 3 dogs and thier names are Rocky, Maddie and Hansol. Computers have always been interesting to me. Ever since I was a kid I was always intrigued by computers but I never got a hold of one when until I took a typing class in middle school. So naturally, I felt a field in computers was my calling. Before web developement I studied to a network administrator, in which I got a degree in. As a benefit I was able to apply as work-study at the school I was attending There I learned alot about troubleshooting different types of problems. Also learned how to use photoshop, which I used to make  flyer and posters for my school.
 
 After a year and half of working and studing, things turned for the worst. The school I was attending ended up closing down. So I ended up losing my job and couldn't continue school. As well as my car breaking down. Soon after some time, I started thinking about the next step in my life and I remeber how much I really enjoyed designing on photoshop and learning how to code for my visual basic class that I took while attending school. I soon found **San Diego Continuing Education** which held classes in web devoplement and began my journey. Since then I have always tryed to look forward as well as live in the moment.
